Problem Statement
Air Force ROTC cadets' flight rankings and ROTC course grades are determined by their performance, attendance, and peer evaluations throughout the academic term.  Currently, this information is documented on paper and is not backed up, making the system inefficient and unstable.  To eliminate these problems an application is needed for Air Force ROTC cadets and instructors to electronically submit and review the aforementioned information.

Background Information
Air Force ROTC cadets take required ROTC classes each semester and participate in various activities.  Cadets are evaluated during these settings by their flight commander and peers.  A cadet’s evaluation is based upon on several criteria: performance, attendance, and peer feedback.  The evaluations are normally hand written or typed and stored in a cadet’s individual folder.  At the semester’s end, the flight commander reviews each cadet’s folder to determine their overall flight ranking and course grade.  Our application will be used by AFROTC flight commanders and cadets at Purdue University and give them the ability to electronically submit and review a cadet’s evaluations.  
Currently, there are no similar applications in existence.  As stated, the current system requires hand-written or typed evaluations that are stored in folders for future reference and the documentation is not backed up.  The manual system is time consuming since most documentation is hand written and must be sorted through manually.  The Cadet Profiler addresses this issue by providing electronic submissions.  Another limitation is the poor organization.  The documentation is organized into cadet folders, however, the documents within the folder and sorted randomly.  This issue is addressed by collecting documentation in a database then categorizing the data into cadet user accounts by date and category.  The use of an online database also provides a backup of the documentation.
